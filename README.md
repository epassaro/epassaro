## Hi there! 👋

I'm a software developer and astronomy student at the National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. I enjoy working on tools that support scientific research — especially when it involves automation, reproducibility, and open collaboration.

Most of my open-source work has focused on scientific software for astrophysics and continuous integration pipelines. I’m particularly interested in software distribution and building reliable infrastructure for researchers.
