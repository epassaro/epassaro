I'm a software developer and astronomy student at the National University of La Plata (UNLP), Argentina. I enjoy working on tools that support scientific research — especially when it involves automation, reproducibility, and open collaboration.

Most of my open-source work has focused on scientific software for astrophysics, including continuous integration systems and packaging solutions. I’m particularly interested in Linux development, software distribution, and building reliable infrastructure for researchers.

### 🔭 Areas of interest
- Open-source scientific software
- CI/CD and workflow automation
- Software packaging
- Linux tooling and development
- Machine Learning & AI
